# runelite-plugins
A collection of new or modified plugins for runelite (All *should* adhere to Jagex's recent statement)

For the most part these plugins should just be able to be dragged and dropped into the plugins folder of runelite.
Where the plugin already exists* it should replace the existing runelite plugin.

List of (indented) plugins:

- Tears of Guthix: Adds an indicator to the overlay showing what skill will receive the xp reward (No more wasted runecrafting xp!)

- Impling Jars: Adds tracking of loot from impling jars to default loot tracking plugin


* Existing plugins from the base runelite maintain their original copyright for any original source code and are redistributed under these conditions.
See https://github.com/runelite/runelite/ for full details.
